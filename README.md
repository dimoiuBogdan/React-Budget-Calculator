This is a project I decided to create because I really liked the simple design I wanted for it. It is a simple react project, but it managed to make me confident to go to more difficult react projects.
In this app I used / made : 
  - TailwindCSS
  - Dark / Light Theme
  - Local Storage
  - Responsive using TailwindCSS
